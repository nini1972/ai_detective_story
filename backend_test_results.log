🔍 Testing visual question 1: 'What exactly did you see that night?'

🔍 Testing Question Character...
✅ Passed - Status: 200
Character name: Eleanor Godfrey
Response: (Soft sigh, Eleanor smooths her silk cuffs.)

Detective, I confess the evening is something of a haze, but I shall do my best. After returning from my walk on the terrace just past eight, I went upstairs to change—Mrs. Sullivan, the housekeeper, glimpsed me in the corridor, I believe. I was in my suite for much of the hour, sorting through correspondence and preparing for dinner. I recall hearing muffled voices from Arthur's study; Simon Travers, his business associate, was pressing him on something—I suppose you’ve spoken to Simon?

At one point, I passed Ivy Barnes on the landing; she seemed rather distraught, though she hid it well. Dr. LeClerc arrived after nine, I think, coat still damp from the fog. I never entered Arthur’s study that evening. I did notice an odd sweet scent in the corridor around half past nine, but thought nothing of it at the time.

🔍 Testing Question Character...
✅ Passed - Status: 200
Character name: Eleanor Godfrey
Response: (With a steady, controlled voice tinged with sorrow, Eleanor smooths a silk scarf at her throat before answering.)

Of course, Inspector. I spent the evening in my suite preparing for the dinner—going over the seating and reviewing the menu with Mrs. Sullivan. I didn’t see Arthur after tea. Around nine, I stepped into the corridor to ask the housekeeper, Ivy, about fresh linens; she can confirm that much, though we only spoke briefly. I heard Simon Travers’s voice from downstairs—he and Arthur were in heated debate earlier, about that painting Arthur acquired, I believe. 

The fog was horrendous, and the whole house felt on edge, as though we were waiting for a storm. I noticed Dr. LeClerc arrive late; he seemed out of sorts. But I swear, I never went near the study that night. I kept to my rooms, trying to calm my nerves. Is that… sufficient, Inspector?

Character name: Eleanor Godfrey
Response: (With a faint tremor in her voice, Eleanor folds her gloved hands in her lap, gaze unfocused as she remembers.)

I’m not sure I’ll ever forget that moment, Detective. It was around half past nine, I believe. I’d just finished speaking with Mrs. Sullivan—she fusses terribly over the floral arrangements—and went to fetch a shawl from my suite. I heard a peculiar sound—like something heavy falling—in the corridor by Arthur’s study. At first, I thought it was the wind off the sea rattling the windows again, but then Simon Travers appeared at the top of the stairs, looking rather ashen. He’d tried the door and called for Arthur, but there was no answer.

We found it locked. I suppose Arthur treasured his privacy. Dr. LeClerc was summoned and—well, you know the rest. I scarcely remember anything after seeing Arthur at his desk like that. The scent in the room… it was strange, almost sweet.

Character name: Eleanor Godfrey
Response: (With carefully measured composure, Eleanor folds her gloved hands in her lap, her gaze distant.)

I wish I could tell you, Detective, but I didn’t witness any confrontation, if that's what you're implying. Arthur and I barely exchanged words after I returned from Paris, at least not the sort that rise to dramatics. 

I was in my rooms preparing for the dinner, sorting out which gown might impress upon his guests that the Godfreys still care for appearances. Mrs. Sullivan, the housekeeper, saw me near the corridor just after nine, if that helps. The house was unusually quiet… but if you’re searching for heated words, Simon Travers and Arthur quarrelled just last week over that dreadful Modigliani forgery—tempers in this house were never in short supply.

Honestly, if you’re suggesting I confronted Arthur, you’re mistaken. I had more to lose than to gain—believe me.

🔍 Testing visual question 5: 'Can you describe what you witnessed?'

🔍 Testing Question Character...
✅ Passed - Status: 200
Character name: Eleanor Godfrey
Response: Of course, detective. I was in my suite dressing for the dinner—I confess, it takes longer these days to find the right ensemble. Around nine, I stepped into the corridor; Mrs. Sullivan, the housekeeper, passed by with fresh linens. I barely glimpsed Arthur all evening. Our rooms are at opposite ends, you see.

I heard voices in the foyer—Simon Travers was heated about something, arguing over the phone, I believe, though I could not catch every word. Dr. LeClerc was in the library, or claimed to be—I noticed he seemed rather anxious when I passed him later.

I never entered Arthur’s study. He’d become so... private. The staff were bustling, as always, with Ivy darting about nervously. The weather was wretched—the fog quite unnatural even for Mirador. I thought I smelled... something odd on the landing, but imagined it was some new cleaning solvent.

Is there anything else, detective?

✅ Passed - Status: 200
Character name: Eleanor Godfrey
Response: (With a careful composure, Eleanor folds her gloved hands in her lap, gaze lingering on the window.)

Detective, I—well, I saw very little, truthfully. By the time I heard about Arthur, your men had already closed off the study. But the housekeeper, Mrs. Sullivan, was in quite a state—she kept muttering about some “awful sweet smell,” which is hardly typical for that room; Arthur despised sweets, you know.

As for the study itself, when I passed by earlier on my way to dress, the windows were always kept shut—Arthur was fastidious about drafts. Strange that one was left open last night. I can’t say I saw anyone enter. Though, come to think of it, Simon Travers seemed unusually tense during dinner preparations and was missing for a spell. Perhaps he was merely out for a smoke. 

I wish I could be of more help. It’s all so terribly unreal.

🔍 Testing Question Character...
✅ Passed - Status: 200
Character name: Eleanor Godfrey
Response: Detective, forgive me, but my memory is—well, rather clouded. The night felt peculiarly tense, you see. The fog was beginning to press against the windows, and even the house seemed to settle uneasily as the hour grew later.

I was in my suite, just after eight, selecting a gown for dinner. The housekeeper, Mrs. Sullivan, knocked to ask if I needed anything. I remember hearing hurried footsteps in the corridor—possibly Ivy, Arthur’s secretary—she seemed overwrought of late. Around nine, I glanced out and saw Simon Travers pacing on the terrace below, mumbling to himself.

As for Arthur…I didn’t see him all evening after we exchanged a few words before supper. Truthfully, our conversations lately have been…strained.

If you must know, Dr. LeClerc appeared agitated at dinner, fidgeting with his watch. The atmosphere was… charged, detective. As if something inevitable was about to happen.

🔍 NEW CHARACTERS DISCOVERED: 1
  - Arthur Godfrey (A man in his late fifties, Arthur was tall and lean, with thinning silver hair brushed meticulously back from a high forehead. He had piercing grey eyes, often cold and appraising, and an aristocratic bearing heightened by his tailored suits and measured speech. Lately, he wore a pinched, distracted expression, as if perpetually caught between suspicion and worry.)
    Discovered through: Eleanor Godfrey
    Context: Eleanor mentions 'Arthur's secretary' (referring to Ivy) and says 'As for Arthur…I didn't see him all evening after we exchanged a few words before supper. Truthfully, our conversations lately have been…strained.' Arthur appears to be a central figure who Eleanor had strained conversations with.

🔍 Testing Question Character...
✅ Passed - Status: 200
Character name: Arthur Godfrey
Response: [Arthur adjusts his cufflinks meticulously, his grey eyes lingering on the fogged window before turning to you. His tone is clipped, precise, but weighed with fatigue.]

Aside from myself, Eleanor was, as usual, in her sitting room—she prefers solitude in the evenings. Simon Travers, my...assistant, was meant to catalogue a few pieces in the gallery, though whether he actually accomplished anything is often in doubt. Dr. LeClerc remained in the lounge, nursing his brandy and pontificating on some medical treatise. Mrs. Sullivan, the housekeeper, kept to her routines—she runs the staff with a firmer hand than I ever could. Ivy Barnes, my niece, claims to have taken a walk on the cliffs around dusk, though I didn’t see her return. The gardener left early—the roses, I believe, excuse enough. To my knowledge, no visitors. The household is small, detective, but bear in mind—everyone keeps their own counsel here.

  - Silas Dunphy (A wiry man in his late fifties, Silas wears weathered overalls and battered boots, his hands perpetually stained with soil. Sun-creased skin, thinning ash-grey hair tucked beneath a battered cap, and pale blue eyes that miss little, lend him a quiet, wary presence. He speaks sparingly, with a gruff Californian twang, but his silence is observant rather than sullen.)

Response: (Silas shifts his weight, cap pulled low, thumbs hooked in the belt loops of his overalls. He speaks slow and measured, eyes darting briefly towards the heavy coastal mist hanging beyond the window.)

“Suspicious, you say? Well… this house’s always got folks movin’ about where they shouldn’t. That afternoon, I seen Miss Ivy—housemaid—loiterin’ by the study door earlier than her usual dustin’ hour. She looked jumpy, like she’d heard a fox in the henhouse. Simon Travers too—pacing out back, near the old yew, muttering up a storm. Never did like the salt air, that one. As for me, I left just after four—had to fetch supplies Mr. Godfrey asked for, so I weren’t here when… well, when it happened. Folks in town can vouch fer that. But if you’re askin’, there was a tension round here all week. Somethin’ was brewing, sure as fog off the bluff.”

Response: *Silas shifts on his boots, cap pulled low, eyes flicking up just once before fixing on a patch of floor.*

Aye, there were folks about. Mrs. Sullivan was in and outta the kitchen most the mornin’—heard her clatterin’ pans ‘round noon. Ivy Barnes, she was tidyin’ the west wing, hummin’ like usual. Mr. Travers poked round the gardens after lunch, stampin’ mud on the cobbles—never met a man who liked his walks more. Dr. LeClerc was meant to check on Mr. Godfrey’s nerves, but I didn’t see him myself. Mrs. Godfrey stayed shut up with her books from midday on, at least so far as I noticed.

No outsiders came far as I saw. Just the house folks. Wasn’t much unusual, not before I left for town. If you’re askin’ ‘bout strangers, well—Mirador don’t get ‘em, what with the fog and all.

Response: (He takes off his battered cap, rubbing a muddy thumb along its brim, eyes steady on the floorboards rather than your face.)

Well, reckon that's a question for Mrs. Sullivan mostly—housekeeper keeps tighter tabs on keys than the rest of us. Study's doors are usually locked unless Mr. Godfrey’s in there or expecting someone. Far as I know, only Mrs. Sullivan, Mr. Travers—Arthur’s assistant—and sometimes Mrs. Godfrey herself had their own keys. Rest of us? We knock, and that’s that.

That said... Ivy—Miss Barnes—runs errands up there, tea and such, though mostly with someone else present. Saw Dr. LeClerc coming and going too, these past days, what with Arthur’s complaints about his nerves.

Can’t say more than that. Wasn’t my place—I had my hands full outdoors. Didn’t see anyone slip inside who shouldn’t, and that’s the truth.

Response: *Silas shifts his weight, the toes of one boot scuffing the tiled floor. He doesn’t meet your eyes at first, gaze flicking instead to the window and the persistent creep of coastal fog.*

Mr. Godfrey kept his cards close, if y’ask me. Most days he’d hole up in that study, sometimes call for Mrs. Sullivan about the ledgers or for tea. This morning, though, I did hear him bickering with Simon Travers—weren’t the first time, won’t be the last. Simon’s got ideas about the grounds—Arthur never liked being told what to do. And Mrs. Godfrey, well, she passed by the rose garden around three. She seemed… distracted. As for the rest—Dr. LeClerc stuck to his own business, and Ivy, the maid, was fussing with linens upstairs last I noticed. Folks keep to their roles around here, but the walls? They don’t lack for listening.
