✅ Passed - Status: 200
Character name: Vivienne Starling
Response: Detective, I assure you, my evening was tragically dull compared to what followed. After dinner, I retired early—Reginald and I had exchanged rather…heated words, and I thought it best not to linger. I entered my bedroom just before midnight; young Elsie saw me, I believe. I began undressing, brushing my hair. There was a storm—you must have heard it, rattling the windows terribly. I heard Reginald’s study door slam at some point, but paid it little mind. As for others, Charles Blackwood was lingering in the hall after supper, muttering to himself. Eleanor appeared anxious, pacing outside her room. And the doctor—Dr. Mallory—was nowhere to be seen for quite some time. I heard footsteps, but with these old floorboards, who can say from where? I did not leave my room…until the commotion began. If you’re suggesting otherwise, I hope you have more than wild suspicion.

Character name: Vivienne Starling
Response: Detective, I wish I could be of more use, but as I told Inspector Mallory—I was in my room preparing for bed. The storm rattled my nerves; I remember checking the windows were latched. Elsie brought my cocoa just before midnight, and she will confirm that I was alone.

I heard raised voices earlier that evening—Reginald and Charles Blackwood, the business partner. There was tension, undoubtedly, but around here, that’s hardly unusual. Eleanor Finch seemed unsettled, too—pacing the halls with that notebook of hers after supper.

I did hear someone hurried along the corridor, shoes clicking on the marble, but I couldn’t see who in the dim light. Honestly, with the electricity flickering, the whole house felt on edge. If you wish to know more, perhaps Charles or Eleanor could clarify their own whereabouts—I only know I was not near the study.
